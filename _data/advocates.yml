    *"As a person who worked in the highly stressful and fast world of media
    my life came to a crossroads three years ago and I was introduced to
    mindfulness by Susan Whiting.&nbsp; I have come to find the oasis of
    calm that is mindfulness practice to be a saving grace. It has helped to
    teach me not to worry about what I will do the next day, month or year
    but just to stop and enjoy the moment I am in. I would say it has been
    life-changing for me. I am very happy to be an advocate for mindfulness
    and more than eager to share its benefits. The paths I take now are
    slightly different but enrichment follows behind me."*

    I see the way I am now, and the way my life is now, as a testament to
    the transformative and healing power of mindfulness. It is not a path
    for the faint-hearted if, like me, you come from a particularly dark
    place. Like the panther in Rilkeâ€™s poem, I existed in a cage for many
    years, behind bars of emotional distress, loneliness, and livelessness.
    What I learnt in the MBCT courses, the way mindfulness was embodied by
    the teachers, and my own daily mindfulness practice combined to give me
    the strength, clarity, and courage, to free myself into a new existence,
    where there is joy, connectedness with others, and emotional
    expressiveness. Life will always have its challenges, but I have never
    felt more alive; in my work, in my relationships, and - maybe above all
    - in re-finding, sharing, and living, music.

    Diagnosed with recurrent depression, Mike participated in the Trust's
    8-week programme of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in 2009
    and is delighted by the contribution that it made to his ability to
    establish and maintain wellbeing. This has also led him to explore
    approaches to the cultivation of compassion and self-compassion. He is
    very impressed by mindfulness based interventions in contrast with CBT
    and antidepressant medication, especially the way that they may enable a
    person to deal with things in-the-body rather than in-the-head, as a
    form of self-care, without ongoing dependence on medical expertise and
    medicines. The MBCT induction into mindfulness practice has been a
    life-changer. Mike is also impressed by the way that the Sussex
    Mindfulness Centre has developed, with many trained practitioners now, a
    regime of professional supervision, an annual conference, an expanding
    body of research in-progress and professional-development
    master-classes. Well done you guys in the Practice Network!

    'Being diagnosed with emotional intensity disorder and PTSD I took part
    in the group treatments programs and was referred to see if I was
    suitable to take part in a course in mindfulness.&nbsp; I count myself
    very lucky to of done the Mindfullness course as it has impacted on
    life. I feel more present in the moment and it has now become an
    intrigal part of my life. '
