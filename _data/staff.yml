        I see the way I am now, and the way my life is now, as a testament to
        the transformative and healing power of mindfulness. It is not a path
        for the faint-hearted if, like me, you come from a particularly dark
        place. Like the panther in Rilke’s poem, I existed in a cage for many
        years, behind bars of emotional distress, loneliness, and livelessness.
        What I learnt in the MBCT courses, the way mindfulness was embodied by
        the teachers, and my own daily mindfulness practice combined to give me
        the strength, clarity, and courage, to free myself into a new existence,
        where there is joy, connectedness with others, and emotional
        expressiveness. Life will always have its challenges, but I have never
        felt more alive; in my work, in my relationships, and - maybe above all
        - in re-finding, sharing, and living, music.

    - name: Mike Hales
      description_markdown: >-
        Diagnosed with recurrent depression, Mike participated in the Trust's
        8-week programme of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in 2009
        and is delighted by the contribution that it made to his ability to
        establish and maintain wellbeing. This has also led him to explore
        approaches to the cultivation of compassion and self-compassion. He is
        very impressed by mindfulness based interventions in contrast with CBT
        and antidepressant medication, especially the way that they may enable a
        person to deal with things in-the-body rather than in-the-head, as a
        form of self-care, without ongoing dependence on medical expertise and
        medicines. The MBCT induction into mindfulness practice has been a
        life-changer. Mike is also impressed by the way that the Sussex
        Mindfulness Centre has developed, with many trained practitioners now, a
        regime of professional supervision, an annual conference, an expanding
        body of research in-progress and professional-development
        master-classes. Well done you guys in the Practice Network!
