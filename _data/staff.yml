        Alison is undertaking a PhD at the University of Sussex, supervised by
        Helen Startup and Clara Strauss with Claire Rosten and Richard de
        Visser. She has been a clinical psychologist for 14 years and has worked
        in the NHS since 1999. She works part-time clinically in the
        neurobehavioural service and part-time as a doctoral researcher at the
        University of Sussex.


        People diagnosed with 'Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder" can
        experience enduring and intense emotions and high levels of
        distress.&nbsp; It can be hard to get access to the right kind of
        psychological treatment and health practitioners working with this group
        of people often find it hard to know what to offer. The diagnostic label
        itself can sometimes be stigmatising and a barrier to treatment. We know
        that Mindfulness Based Interventions can be acceptable and effective for
        some people and this may be by helping them to be less troubled by
        emotional states.


        Alison's research project will explore what kind of adaptations might
        need to be made to standard Mindfulness Based Interventions to increase
        their acceptability, suitability, safety and effectiveness for people
        with this diagnosis. She will review the existing research literature
        before consulting with relevant staff and people with lived experience.
        She hopes to go on to adapt a standard MBI protocol and run a
        feasibility and acceptability trial and subsequent qualitative
        interviews. The hope is that this will increase the options available
        for people diagnosed with "Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder" so
        that they can more easily access psychological help.

        Her Doctorate research is focusing on &nbsp;Exploring Integrating
        Mindfulness Chinese Calligraphy Enhanced Therapy (CCET) as Complementary
        Psychotherapy to Bridge Underrepresented Chinese Clients in the UK


        Chinese Calligraphy Handwriting (CCH) as a mindfulness-based brush
        meditation intervention has been practised for thousand years in
        China,&nbsp; CCET is a complementary therapy designed as a culturally
        sensitive and non-threatening approach to bridging Chinese clients’
        access to psychological therapy. The 4 sessions of CCET is an innovative
        integrative approach which also draws on cognitive theory, mindfulness
        theory and psychoanalytic theory. The design is inspired by her clinical
        work with Chinese clients in the UK and is also based on personal
        experience of psychotherapy practice and her role as a mindfulness
        teacher for community services.


        Juan hopes this research will provide benefit for culturally-sensitive
        psychological therapy access for the Chinese Community in the UK,
        improve the awareness of a cultural-sensitive psychological approach in
        the psychotherapy community and promote race equality in mental
        healthcare services in the UK.

        *"As a person who worked in the highly stressful and fast world of media
        my life came to a crossroads three years ago and I was introduced to
        mindfulness by Susan Whiting.&nbsp; I have come to find the oasis of
        calm that is mindfulness practice to be a saving grace. It has helped to
        teach me not to worry about what I will do the next day, month or year
        but just to stop and enjoy the moment I am in. I would say it has been
        life-changing for me. I am very happy to be an advocate for mindfulness
        and more than eager to share its benefits. The paths I take now are
        slightly different but enrichment follows behind me."*

        I see the way I am now, and the way my life is now, as a testament to
        the transformative and healing power of mindfulness. It is not a path
        for the faint-hearted if, like me, you come from a particularly dark
        place. Like the panther in Rilke’s poem, I existed in a cage for many
        years, behind bars of emotional distress, loneliness, and livelessness.
        What I learnt in the MBCT courses, the way mindfulness was embodied by
        the teachers, and my own daily mindfulness practice combined to give me
        the strength, clarity, and courage, to free myself into a new existence,
        where there is joy, connectedness with others, and emotional
        expressiveness. Life will always have its challenges, but I have never
        felt more alive; in my work, in my relationships, and - maybe above all
        - in re-finding, sharing, and living, music.

        Diagnosed with recurrent depression, Mike participated in the Trust's
        8-week programme of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in 2009
        and is delighted by the contribution that it made to his ability to
        establish and maintain wellbeing. This has also led him to explore
        approaches to the cultivation of compassion and self-compassion. He is
        very impressed by mindfulness based interventions in contrast with CBT
        and antidepressant medication, especially the way that they may enable a
        person to deal with things in-the-body rather than in-the-head, as a
        form of self-care, without ongoing dependence on medical expertise and
        medicines. The MBCT induction into mindfulness practice has been a
        life-changer. Mike is also impressed by the way that the Sussex
        Mindfulness Centre has developed, with many trained practitioners now, a
        regime of professional supervision, an annual conference, an expanding
        body of research in-progress and professional-development
        master-classes. Well done you guys in the Practice Network\!

        I thought I&nbsp;knew so much about the mind and how it worked, until I
        participated in the 8-week MCBT course. Thoughts are not facts, and our
        brains are more likely to prompt us to react on an 'auto-pilot' response
        rather than to respond with our logical brain, but I've also learned
        that brain rewiring through consistent and daily mindfulness, and other
        healthy habits can help reduce the overthinking tendencies of the
        chaotic 'monkey mind'. Through incorporating yoga and mindfulness into
        my everyday life, along with a well balanced diet, I have come out of
        depression, mood instability, and my anxiety levels have reduced to a
        point that I wouldn't of dreamed of before.


        Through my hardships, I've come to other realisations such as; This is
        happening for a reason, and that reason being that my mental health
        struggles have helped me emphasise with others, helped me express my
        struggles to help others, and also helped motivate me to learn more
        about the mind, how it works, and how to help myself in the long run. I
        hope to take up a teacher training course soon in Yoga, to continue
        spreading awareness of how important it is to be present.&nbsp;
