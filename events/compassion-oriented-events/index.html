    organiser: with Dr Kristin Neff and Dr Chris Germer
    description_markdown: >-
      **Sussex Mindfulness Centre is delighted to host the only UK MSC workshop
      in 2020 from Kristin Neff and Chris Germer**


      **Sat & Sun 18-19 July 2020**


      **9\.00am-5.00pm**


      **Paganini Ballroom, Old Ship Hotel, 31-38 Kings Road, Brighton BN1 1NR**


      The MSC Core Skills program is a workshop and not a retreat.&nbsp; Program
      activities include talks, meditation, experiential exercises, and group
      discussion. Participants will directly experience self-compassion and
      learn practices that evoke self-compassion in daily life (and the
      rationale behind them).


      \*\*This Core Skills Workshop allows an opportunity for people to immerse
      themselves in some of the key practices and exercises of the full 8-week
      program in an intensive 2-day format. \*\*


      **After participating in this workshop, you will be able to:**


      1. Understand the science of self-compassion &nbsp; &nbsp;

      2. Handle difficult emotions with greater ease

      3. Motivate yourself with kindness rather than criticism &nbsp;

      4. Manage caregiver fatigue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      5. Practice the art of savouring and self-appreciation

      6. **Teach simple self-compassion exercises to clients**

      7. **Take the first step towards training as an MSC teacher**


      This workshop is an introduction to MSC and is not a qualification to
      teach the 8-week MSC Course which requires further training. **No previous
      experience with mindfulness or meditation is required to attend the
      program.**


      **Cost****\:**


      &nbsp;**&pound;240 early bird**. &pound;290 from 16 December 2019


      * The price includes tea & coffee with pastries/biscuits during the
      breaks. Lunch or overnight accommodation are not included.


      **&pound;190 early bird** for our Trust-approved mindfulness teachers,
      trainers and SPFT advocates (no free places). &pound;240 from 16 December
