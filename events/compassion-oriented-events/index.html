      (please state which option you want and if there is anyone you want to

      The first stage of the application process is to submit your registration
      form and pay the &pound;500 deposit. All balances must be paid in full by
      22nd February 2021.


      **We're still planning to run our Mindful Self-compassion teacher training
      course at the Ammerdown Retreat Centre 15-21 March 2021, but obviously
      Covid-19 is impacting our ability to provide certainty. This is the last
      time to be taught by Vanessa Hope at a live in-person event, and our
      teachers, Vanessa Hope and Ali Lambie are poised and hoping to teach this
      if they are able.**


      **The Ammerdown Centre has all the social distancing and safety
      precautions in place to accommodate twenty people in single rooms and
      allowing for social distancing in the meeting and dining rooms.**


      **However, we'd like to reassure you that if government rulings mean we
      cannot run it, (or if the tier rulings mean you are not allowed to come),
      then we will refund you.**


      **We ask you to commit to a refundable deposit, but not pay the full
      balance until the situation is clear and we know if it will or will not
      run. If we are able will make this decision mid February, so if it going
      ahead will ask for the full balance by 22 February. (We will refund you in
      full, if we are forced to cancel the course due to government rulings).**

      **9\.00am-5.00pm**


      **Paganini Ballroom, Old Ship Hotel, 31-38 Kings Road, Brighton BN1 1NR**


      The MSC Core Skills program is a workshop and not a retreat.&nbsp; Program
      activities include talks, meditation, experiential exercises, and group
      discussion. Participants will directly experience self-compassion and
      learn practices that evoke self-compassion in daily life (and the
      rationale behind them).


      \*\*This Core Skills Workshop allows an opportunity for people to immerse
      themselves in some of the key practices and exercises of the full 8-week
      program in an intensive 2-day format. \*\*


      **After participating in this workshop, you will be able to:**


      1. Understand the science of self-compassion &nbsp; &nbsp;

      2. Handle difficult emotions with greater ease

      3. Motivate yourself with kindness rather than criticism &nbsp;

      4. Manage caregiver fatigue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      5. Practice the art of savouring and self-appreciation

      6. **Teach simple self-compassion exercises to clients**

      7. **Take the first step towards training as an MSC teacher**


      This workshop is an introduction to MSC and is not a qualification to
      teach the 8-week MSC Course which requires further training. **No previous
      experience with mindfulness or meditation is required to attend the
      program.**


      **Cost****\:**


      **&pound;240 Early bird Standard ticket<br>&pound;290 Standard ticket from
      18 Dec 2020**


      **&pound;190 Early bird Trust-employed ticket<br>&pound;240 Trust-employed
