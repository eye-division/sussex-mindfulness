Understand the science of self-compassion &nbsp; &nbsp;\n2. Handle difficult emotions with greater ease\n3. Motivate yourself with kindness rather than criticism &nbsp;\n4. Manage caregiver fatigue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n5. Practice the art of savouring and self-appreciation\n6. **Teach simple self-compassion exercises to clients**\n7. **Take the first step towards training as an MSC teacher**\n\nThis workshop is an introduction to MSC and is not a qualification to teach the 8-week MSC Course which requires further training. **No previous experience with mindfulness or meditation is required to attend the program.**\n\n**Cost****\\:**\n\n&nbsp;**&pound;240 early bird**. &pound;290 from 16 December 2019\n\n* The price includes tea & coffee with pastries/biscuits during the breaks.
