      themselves in some of the key practices and exercises of the full 8-week

      1. Understand the science of self-compassion &nbsp; &nbsp;

      2. Handle difficult emotions with greater ease

      3. Motivate yourself with kindness rather than criticism &nbsp;

      4. Manage caregiver fatigue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      5. Practice the art of savouring and self-appreciation

      6. **Teach simple self-compassion exercises to clients**

      7. **Take the first step towards training as an MSC teacher**

      program.**
