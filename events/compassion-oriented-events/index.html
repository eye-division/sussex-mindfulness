      The MSC Core Skills program is a workshop and not a retreat.&nbsp; Program
      activities include talks, meditation, experiential exercises, and group
      discussion. Participants will directly experience self-compassion and
      learn practices that evoke self-compassion in daily life (and the
      rationale behind them).

      themselves in some of the key practices and exercises of the full 8-week
      program in an intensive 2-day format. \*\*

      1. Understand the science of self-compassion &nbsp; &nbsp;

      2. Handle difficult emotions with greater ease

      3. Motivate yourself with kindness rather than criticism &nbsp;

      4. Manage caregiver fatigue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      5. Practice the art of savouring and self-appreciation

      6. **Teach simple self-compassion exercises to clients**

      7. **Take the first step towards training as an MSC teacher**


      This workshop is an introduction to MSC and is not a qualification to
      teach the 8-week MSC Course which requires further training. **No previous
      experience with mindfulness or meditation is required to attend the
      program.**
