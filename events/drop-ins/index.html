<p>All drop-ins are free of charge and are open to anyone who has both completed an eight-week MBCT or MBSR group and who is either a current or ex service user, or current employee of Sussex Partnership. If this applies to you, no booking is required.</p>

</div>
<div class="editable">
  <p>Please bring your own mat, cushion/stool and blanket if possible. Limited numbers of these will be available at the day retreats but there will only be chairs at the drop-ins.</p>
  <p>Please note these sessions are for adults. Drop in sessions for young people are held separately and details of these can be found on the Child and Adolescent page of this website.</p>
  <p>Lucy Edwards and Stuart Clark have been running a pilot of mindfulness drop in sessions for trust staff working in Adur, Arun and Worthing. Following staff consultation, they are able to offer 30 minutes mindfulness drop ins for staff working in Arun, Adur and Worthing from June 2018. These will be offered twice monthly and the location will alternate between Arun House and Swandean.</p>
