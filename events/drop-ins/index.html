  <p>All drop-ins are free of charge. The drop ins at the Sussex Education Centre in Hove are open to anyone who has both completed an 8 week MBCT or MBSR group and who is either a current or ex service user, or current employee of Sussex Partnership. Drop ins at Arun house and Swandean are for Sussex Partnership staff only and do not require previous mindfulness experience. No booking is required for any drop in sessions.</p>

  <p>Please bring your own mat, cushion/stool and blanket if possible. Limited numbers of these will be available at the day retreats but there will only be chairs at the drop-ins.</p>
  <p>Please note these sessions are for adults. Drop in sessions for young people are held separately and details of these can be found on the Child and Adolescent page of this website.</p>
