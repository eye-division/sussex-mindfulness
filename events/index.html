  <h3><strong>SMC Annual Conference 2018</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Friday 21st Sept 2018, Sussex Education Centre in Hove</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The theme of our 2018 conference was community mindfulness: staying connected, local and accessible.

  <h3><strong>SMC Annual Conference 2019</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Saturday 23 March and Sunday 24 March 2019 in Hove</strong></p>
  <p>This will be in collaboration with other mindfulness centres in the UK who are hoping to hold parallel conferences on the same dates. The conference will coincide with an international mindfulness conference in South Africa from where we are hoping to live stream two keynote talks, including from Jon Kabat Zinn.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Saturday will be a day of talks and discussion, with time for networking and spending time together as a mindfulness community. The Sunday will be a day of practice.</p>
  <p>*Please note, that we had previously advertised the conference as running from 22-26 March 2019 but this has been changed due to unforeseen changes to the funding arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We are not currently taking bookings for the 2019 conference as it is too far in advance, but you can <a href="/events/conferences/">register your interest</a>.</p>
