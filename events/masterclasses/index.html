      **Exploring mindful movement practice**&nbsp;


      Mindful Movement is a fundamental part of mindfulness teaching, offering
      ways to make deeper contact with the body and to bring us more fully into
      the present moment. Emotional patterns often show up in the body before
      the mind notices them and working with the body in movement can open the
      way to greater choice and freedom.


      This programme is designed for those who are teaching Mindfulness-Based
      courses. The emphasis will be on deepening understanding of personal
      mindful movement practice through experience and exploration in a way that
      encourages curiosity and further integration with other mindfulness
      practices.

      **Buddhist Foundation of Mindfulness**


      **A day of practice, teaching and discussion**


      &nbsp;


      **Even though many of us deliver entirely secular MBCT or MBSR programmes,
      many of the ideas in contemporary mindfulness-based programmes make more
      sense when we understand their origins and intentions.&nbsp;**


      **John Peacock is one of the few people who can expertly make this bridge
      and we are delighted to welcome him back again to Brighton.&nbsp; **


      To book your place please contact Sussex Mindfulness Centre for a booking
