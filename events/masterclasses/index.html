      Exploring mindful movement practice (rearranged from 29 March)


      Mindful Movement is a fundamental part of mindfulness teaching, offering
      ways to make deeper contact with the body and to bring us more fully into
      the present moment. Emotional patterns often show up in the body before
      the mind notices them and working with the body in movement can open the
      way to greater choice and freedom.


      This programme is designed for those who are teaching Mindfulness-Based
      courses. The emphasis will be on deepening understanding of personal
      mindful movement practice through experience and exploration in a way that
      encourages curiosity and further integration with other mindfulness
      practices.
