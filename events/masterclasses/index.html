      The day will chart the unfolding of the story of MBCT research and

      **Participants will be supported to situate ourselves within the evolving
      story with invitations to inquire into the role we are all playing – how
      is our &nbsp;MBCT practice situated? What are the questions and dilemmas
      we are experiencing?**
