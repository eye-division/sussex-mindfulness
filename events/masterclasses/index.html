      The human stress process is a double-edged sword. On one side, it allows
      us to survive, compete and meet our own basic needs and those we care for.
      On the other side, by virtue of having a conceptual mind, our habitual
      stress process also generates much of our subjective suffering and is the
      fundamental trigger and driving mechanism for our most challenging and
      disabling afflictions ranging from ‘mental’ disorders such as depression,
      anxiety and dementia to ‘physical’ disorders such as obesity, bowel
      disease and cancer. &nbsp;


      As mindfulness teachers and therapists, a deeper understanding of the
      experiential nature, psychological processes, and neurobiological
      mechanisms of stress, particularly chronic stress, can provide us with a
      range of resources informing how we can harness and tame our own stress
      response, as well as what and how we teach or treat our clients. &nbsp;


      Over the course of this day, our shared exploration will follow the human
      stress process as it unfolds through the various stages of perception,
      attention, appraisal, reactivity, regulation and integration. We will also
      investigate how each stage in this universal process is intimately linked
      with many therapeutic processes and, in particular, the teaching
      intentions, methods and sequence underpinning all mindfulness-based
      interventions. &nbsp;

      Relational Mindfulness


      In this one-day workshop, based on the meditative practice of Insight
      Dialogue (ID) participants will have an opportunity to focus on
      relationality in and of itself. This is an invaluable opportunity for
      teachers to enhance, and refine, their interpersonal skills through
      learning six ID relational meditation guidelines. These guidelines have
      been specifically developed by Insight meditation teacher Gregory Kramer,
      to support people in cultivating their capacity for mindful presence in
      relationship.

      Exploring mindful movement practice (rearranged from 29 March)


      Mindful Movement is a fundamental part of mindfulness teaching, offering
      ways to make deeper contact with the body and to bring us more fully into
      the present moment. Emotional patterns often show up in the body before
      the mind notices them and working with the body in movement can open the
      way to greater choice and freedom.


      This programme is designed for those who are teaching Mindfulness-Based
      courses. The emphasis will be on deepening understanding of personal
      mindful movement practice through experience and exploration in a way that
      encourages curiosity and further integration with other mindfulness
      practices.
