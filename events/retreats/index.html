  <p>Day retreats or all days are held on Saturdays from 10am to 4pm at Sussex Education Centre, Nevill Avenue, Hove, BN3 7HZ on the Mill View Hospital and Hove Polyclinic site.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you have attended an 8-week MBCT or MBSR course and are a current or previous Sussex Partnership service user, current staff member or current Sussex Mindfulness Centre trainee, please just turn up - no booking or payment is required. Please bring your own lunch, and also mat, cushion/stool and blanket if possible, as there are only a few available.</p>
  <p>You'll need to attend for the whole day; it's not possible to only come for a portion of the day - thank you for your co-operation.</p>
  <p>Below are the dates for 2020:</p>
