<p>Day retreats or all days are usually held on Saturdays from 10am to 4pm at Sussex Education Centre. Please bring your own lunch, mat, cushion/stool and blanket if possible as there are only a few available. You'll need to attend for the whole day; it's not possible to only come for a portion of the day as it will affect the rest of the group in an unhelpful way - thank you for your co-operation. Below are the dates for 2017:</p>
