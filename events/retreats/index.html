      If Covid restrictions mean our dropins are going to be held online via
      zoom please email
      [smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk](mailto:smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk) and
      ask for the joining link and password.&nbsp;


      Please consider in advance what will best support you during the
      day.&nbsp; We will be aiming to maintain silence through the day (from 10
      until just before 4pm including during breaks and lunch) and refraining as
      far as possible from other distractions that are likely to interrupt the
      thread of your presence of mind - for example, we strongly suggest you
      turn off phones and other online activities, avoid reading and writing
      anything more than very brief notes, and let anyone you may live with or
      who may contact you know what you are doing, so for the 6 hours of this
      event, you minimise interactions as far as you can. &nbsp;

  <p>Due to Covid-19 social distancing rules, day retreats (or mindfulness 'all days') are currently held on online. They run from 10am to 4pm, but we ask people to join from 9.50-9.55am for a 10am prompt start.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you have attended an 8-week MBCT or MBSR course and are a current or previous Sussex Partnership service user, current staff member or current Sussex Mindfulness Centre trainee, you are welcome to participate. No payment is required. In order to book a place and receive joining details, please email <a href="mailto:smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk">smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk</a></p>
  <p>You'll need to attend for the whole day; it's not possible to only come for a portion of the day - thank you for your co-operation.</p>
