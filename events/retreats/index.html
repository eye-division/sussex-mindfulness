  <p>Due to coronavirus social distancing, day retreats (sometimes called 'all days') are currently held on online from 10am to 4pm.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you have attended an 8-week MBCT or MBSR course and are a current or previous Sussex Partnership service user, current staff member or current Sussex Mindfulness Centre trainee, you are welcome to participate. No payment is required. In order to book a place and receive joining details, please email <a href="mailto:smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk">smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk</a></p>
  <p>You'll need to attend for the whole day; it's not possible to only come for a portion of the day - thank you for your co-operation.</p>
  <p>Below are the dates for 2020:</p>
