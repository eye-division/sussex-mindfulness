      The day will be facilitated by Lucy Edwards, Sarah Franks, Anita Raybould,
      Gerry Harris, Catherine Cameron and Robert Marx.


      The day is going to be held online via zoom. If you would like to take
      part, please email
      [smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk](mailto:smc@sussexpartnership.nhs.uk) and
      ask for the joining link and password.&nbsp; Please do not share it with
      anyone but direct any other interested people you may know to email SMC.


      Please aim to join on 14th Nov by 9.50-9.55am for a prompt 10am start,
      finishing at 4pm.&nbsp; Please arrange to stay for the whole day.&nbsp;
      There will be breaks in the day but if you choose to come, in order to
      support the cohesion of the whole group practising together, we ask that
      you commit to attending for the whole of the scheduled time.&nbsp;


      Please consider in advance what will best support you during the
      day.&nbsp; We will be aiming to maintain silence through the day (from 10
      until just before 4pm including during breaks and lunch) and refraining as
      far as possible from other distractions that are likely to interrupt the
      thread of your presence of mind - for example, we strongly suggest you
      turn off phones and other online activities, avoid reading and writing
      anything more than very brief notes, and let anyone you may live with or
      who may contact you know what you are doing, so for the 6 hours of this
      event, you minimise interactions as far as you can. &nbsp;
