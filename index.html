     <p><img class="image--left" alt="Black Lives Matter" src="/assets/images/blacklivesmatter.png" />Sussex Mindfulness Centre supports the Black Lives Matter movement and totally rejects discrimination based on ethnic, racial and other kinds of difference. As a mindfulness community, we recognise that the cause of suffering in individuals cannot be seen only in terms of internal processes and must be thought of in the context of the unequal power structures in society that shape those processes. As a part of the NHS, we strive to work towards a society in which our services are accessible and welcoming to all those who need them. We recognise and respect our differences; we celebrate the rich contribution made to society by a multiplicity of voices; and we commit to continue to learn from them by listening deeply to their wisdom.</p>
