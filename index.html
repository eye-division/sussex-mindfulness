    <h2><a href="/what-is-mindfulness/">What is mindfulness?</a></h2>
    <p>Mindfulness is a particular kind of awareness that arises from an open, kind attentiveness to experience. The emphasis in the practice of cultivating mindfulness is not so much about trying to change experience but to bring a deep noticing and radical acceptance to whatever arises. This encourages a capacity to ‘be’ as well as to ‘do’.</p>
