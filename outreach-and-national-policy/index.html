It is a collaboration of Bangor, Oxford, and Exeter universities, Sussex Mindfulness Centre and the Mental Health Foundation . They've hosted meetings of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Mindfulness which met in Parliament in 2014 and which took testimony given by members of staff and service users (including from Sussex Partnership) and led to the publication of the <a href="http://www.themindfulnessinitiative.org.uk/images/reports/Mindfulness-APPG-Report_Mindful-Nation-UK_Oct2015.pdf">Mindful Nation</a> report. SMC helped to organise the health events for the All Party Parliamentary Group and contributed to the health chapter in the Mindful Nation report.</p><p><a class="button" href="/assets/documents/parliamentary_report_-_the_mindful_nation.pdf">Download&nbsp;<svg class="icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-download_alt" /></svg></a></p></div>
