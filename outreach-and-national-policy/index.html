	<p>The national Mindfulness Initiative is a collaboration of Bangor, Oxford, and Exeter universities, the Sussex Mindfulness Centre and the Mental Health Foundation, led by co-directors Madeleine Bunting and Ed Halliwell. They've hosted meetings of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Mindfulness which met in Parliament in 2014 and which took testimony given by members of staff and service users from Sussex Partnership.</p>
