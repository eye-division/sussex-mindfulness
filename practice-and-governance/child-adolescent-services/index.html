<p>Since 2010, CAMHS practitioners within Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust and Brighton &amp; Hove Council have been working in partnership to develop, deliver and evaluate a seven-week MBCT-adapted course for young people (14-18 years) coping with stress, anxiety and depression.</p>
</div>

<div class="editable">
<p>With research and supervision support from the Sussex Mindfulness Centre, and the help and feedback from young people and parents, the course continues to be revised and developed to meet the needs of young people locally.</p>
<p>Young People from Brighton and Hove CAMHS are currently working with Surrey University to develop a Mindfulness App for young people.</p>
<p>Our lead for mindfulness in child and adolescent services, Dr Brenda Davis, is speaking at this national conference.</p>

<h3>Feedback from Young People</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>I’m a lot better about going to school and when I’m at school I don’t get so nervous. I don’t think about what other people are thinking about as much. It helps me to concentrate more on what I’m doing<br /><cite>(female 17yrs).</cite></p>
