  <p><strong>Sussex Partnership is providing twelve free mindfulness courses, as well as a mindful self-compassion course, for staff across the Trust in 2020. These courses have been run in Sussex Partnership for 15 years and have been shown to reduce stress and increase well-being.&nbsp; Although they could be the first step in training to be a mindfulness teacher, their main purpose is to support staff wellbeing. The groups, are listed below. DUE TO COVID-19 WE ARE OFFERING COURSES UNTIL THE END OF 2020 VIA ZOOM - this means the location of the course is less important:&nbsp;</strong></p>
