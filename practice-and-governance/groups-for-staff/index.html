  <p><strong>We are delighted to let you know that the Trust is providing ten free mindfulness courses for staff across the Trust in 2020. These courses have been run in Sussex Partnership for about 15 years now and have been shown to reduce stress and increase well-being.&nbsp; Although they could be the first step in training to be a mindfulness teacher, their main purpose is to support staff well-being.&nbsp; </strong></p>
