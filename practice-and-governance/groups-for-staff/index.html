  <p><strong>We are delighted to let you know that the Trust is providing ten free mindfulness courses, as well as a mindful self-compassion course, for staff across the Trust in 2020. These courses have been run in Sussex Partnership for 15 years and have been shown to reduce stress and increase well-being.&nbsp; Although they could be the first step in training to be a mindfulness teacher, their main purpose is to support staff wellbeing. The groups, are listed below and will be updated as they become available.</strong></p>
