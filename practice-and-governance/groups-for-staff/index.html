  <p>We have provided mindfulness groups for Sussex Partnership staff for about 15 years.</p>
  <p>Download:&nbsp;<a href="/assets/documents/staff participant info_sheet updated Apr 15.doc">Read about what's involved in a staff mindfulness group</a>.</p>
  <p>There are 12 mindfulness courses running in Kent, Surrey and Sussex in the first half of 2019, four of these courses will be in Sussex. The courses have been funded by Health Education England in Kent, Surrey and Sussex. These courses are free to attend for Sussex Partnership staff and you can attend courses in any of the three counties.</p>
  <p><strong>Due to their popularity, all the courses in Sussex and Kent are now full but there are places remaining on the Surrey courses.</strong></p>

It will also include a full day of practice on Sat 16th November.</p>
