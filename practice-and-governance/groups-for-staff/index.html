  <p>We have provided mindfulness groups for Sussex Partnership staff for about 15 years.</p>

  <p>Currently there is only one group in 2018 that is available for staff. This is a Mindful Self-Compassion group which is a 9 week mindfulness group with a strong emphasis on kindness and compassion.&nbsp; More information about this style of group is available from <a href="https://centerformsc.org/">https://centerformsc.org/</a>. If you would like to sign up for it, please complete this form: <a href="/staff Ms gp booking form 2018.doc">Staff Course Application</a> and send it to <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(115,109,99,64,115,117,115,115,101,120,112,97,114,116,110,101,114,115,104,105,112,46,110,104,115,46,117,107))">smc@sssexpartnership.nhs.uk</a>.</p>
