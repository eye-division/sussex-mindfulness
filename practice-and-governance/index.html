<div class="intro editable"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/practice-icon.png" title="practice icon" class="image--left">We run mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) groups across Sussex with adolescents, adults and older people. Our assessment process helps make sure that MBCT is suitable for people who are referred. Groups are evaluated to help us understand how they are effective. We also run less formal mindfulness groups in various settings where they are adapted for local populations.</p>
