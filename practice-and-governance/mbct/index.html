<div class="intro editable">
<p>The MBCT course usually begins with an introductory session, followed by eight classes. Each class typically lasts two hours and classes usually occur once a week.</p>
</div>

<div class="editable"><p>Typically, each class starts with a mindfulness practice. Mindfulness practice involves bringing our attention to our present-moment experience, as best we can. For example, we might pay attention to bodily sensations. Each mindfulness practice is followed by a discussion of people&rsquo;s experiences during the practice. Classes also include some other, relevant exercises.</p><p>We aim to create a friendly and supportive atmosphere in the classes. No one is asked to do anything they don&rsquo;t want to. For example, if you prefer not to speak in front of the whole class, it is fine just to listen to the other participants.</p><p>The size of the class can vary, but is likely to be between 6 and 12 people. The course also involves up to 50 minutes of homework a day. It is important to have the time available for this.</p><p>You can download the following document, that was put together by ex service user participants, to read about their experiences of participating in our MBCT groups:Mindfulness based cognitive therapy - What participants feel about it</p><p>Download: <a href="/uploads/02 Summary of MBCT for people using SPFT services.pdf">Summary of MBCT for people using SPFT services</a></p><p>Download: Read about what's involved in a staff mindfulness group.</p><h3>What should I do if I am interested in taking part in an MBCT course?</h3><p>If you are currently receiving services from us, please speak with one of the clinicians working with you. If this is not the case, but you fall within the catchment area for our Trust&rsquo;s services, please visit your GP to discuss being referred to us.</p><p>After you&rsquo;ve been referred, you may receive a generic initial assessment that will consider a variety of options. Where possible, we will aim to offer you a choice from a range of therapies and courses, including MBCT when this seems helpful.</p><p>Finally, please note that MBCT is available in many, but not all, geographical areas covered by the Trust. We will be training more MBCT therapists, with the aim of making it available to even more areas.<br />&nbsp;</p></div>
