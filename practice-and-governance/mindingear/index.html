    <p>There is a body of research that suggests that mindful driving can improve driver awareness and increase driver safety. Many collisions on the roads are caused due to failure to look properly/emotional/physical distraction. 1 in 5 new drivers will have a collision within the first six months of learning to drive. Failure to look properly is the largest collision factor for young Sussex drivers (and this is the same nationally).</p>

      <p>We were delighted to work with the Road Safety Department of Brighton and Hove Council to see if mindfulness can help. We have worked together with Sarah West, a local film maker to produce a short, engaging film that can be shown to young drivers to introduce mindfulness.</p>

    <div class="half">
    <p>The aim of this short film is to target young drivers, giving them the rationale why the demonstrated mindfulness technique is worth using.  It aims to introduce mindfulness to drivers in order to give them a centring tool to help them fully engage with the road environment when they are driving, and not get distracted. </p>

  <h3>Distraction on the roads</h3>

  <p>Road collisions are rarely accidents – someone has usually made a mistake, deliberate or otherwise.  The largest cause of collisions – for all road users – is failure to look properly.  As well as obvious distractions – mobile phones etc – people’s emotional state and busy lives affect how well they engage with the road environment. It affects their ability to spot risks and plan to avoid them.</p>

</div>

  <p>Penalties for mobile phone use (6pts, fine £200) or careless driving (3pts, fine £100 or court) exist as deterrents, education and awareness campaigns are run. But other than encouraging awareness / advanced driving skills there has been little obvious work undertaken to address the basic human condition.</p>
  <p>People who practise Mindfulness have been shown to be at lower risk on the roads.  We have developed a simple practise to try before moving off to enable better focus on the roads – helping all to <em>Share the Roads, Share the Responsibility</em>.</p>
