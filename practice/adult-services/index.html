<div class="intro editable"><p>MBCT is available in a variety of services&nbsp;</p></div>
<div class="editable"><h3>The Brighton and Hove Wellbeing service</h3><p>is for all people over the age of 18 who live in Brighton and Hove. We offer a range of mental health support for those with common mental health problems such as low mood, stress, anxiety and depression. As part of this service we currently offer 3 Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT) courses over a year.</p><p>You can be referred to The Brighton and Hove Wellbeing service by your GP or alternatively you can ask for a self referral form by calling 0300 002 0060. Once your referral has been received you will be offered an assessment appointment so we can decided together if an MBCT course would be suitable for you.</p><h3>Health in Mind</h3><p>is an NHS organisation that provides courses and other types of therapies that help with stress, anxiety and low mood, to adults across East Sussex (excluding Brighton &amp; Hove). As part of this, we offer mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) courses, usually in Eastbourne, Lewes and Hastings. Further details about Health in Mind can be found at <a href="http://www.healthinmind.org.uk/">http://www.healthinmind.org.uk/</a> If you are interested in attending a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course offered by Health in Mind and are an adult living in East Sussex, you can make a self-referral at <a href="http://www.healthinmind.org.uk/contact">http://www.healthinmind.org.uk/contact</a>&nbsp; or you can ask your GP to make a referral to us. Please mention in the referral that &nbsp;you are interested in attending a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course. If you are referred to Health in Mind, you will usually receive an initial assessment, during which a member of our team will ask more about your current difficulties and think with you about which of our courses and therapies is likely to be most suitable. Sometimes an intervention other than mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may be more helpful, in which case the worker you speak with will advise you of this. If you are already seeing someone in Health in Mind and would like to attend a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course then please discuss this with them.</p><h3>Brighton &amp; Hove Assessment and Treatment service (ATS)</h3><p>is a secondary care adult mental health service in Brighton and Hove. Referral into the service is via GP or other clinical specialist. Once the referral is received and accepted, you will be invited for an initial meeting to consider the most appropriate care for you. One option available is usually MBCT and sometimes other adapted Mindfulness-based Interventions. &nbsp; If you are interested in this and think it may be helpful for you, do talk to the clinician with whom you will discuss your care at that initial meeting. &nbsp;Some other ATS services such as in Worthing and Hastings may also be able to offer MBCT. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div>
