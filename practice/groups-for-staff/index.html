  <p><strong>Sussex Partnership is providing free mindfulness courses for staff across the Trust in 2021. These courses have been run in Sussex Partnership for 15 years and have been shown to reduce stress and increase well-being.&nbsp; Although they could be the first step in training to be a mindfulness teacher, their main purpose is to support staff wellbeing. As we arrange courses for 2021 they will listed below. DUE TO COVID-19 WE ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING COURSES VIA ZOOM - this means the location of the course is less important:&nbsp;</strong></p>
