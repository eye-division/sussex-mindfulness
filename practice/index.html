  <p><img title="practice icon" class="image--left" src="/assets/practice-icon.png" />We run mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) groups across Sussex with adolescents, adults, and people with additional needs. Mindfulness provision within the Trust is accessible to people of all ages and the groups we offer are age-integrated and adjustments are made to support people with additional needs due to their mobility or physical health, to attend. Our assessment process helps make sure that MBCT is suitable for people who are referred and we evaluate our groups to help us understand how they are effective. We also offer adapted mindfulness practices in some settings when this seems helpful for people who would otherwise struggle with more formal group-based mindfulness provision.</p>
