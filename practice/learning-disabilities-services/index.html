  <p><strong>Mindfulness For Adults With Learning &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Disabilities In Sussex Partnership </strong></p>
  <p>It's still early days for mindfulness interventions which try to address the particular needs of people with learning disabilities/intellectual impairment. Many of the published papers have focused on helping people learn a &lsquo;Soles of the Feet&rsquo; practice to cope when they find life difficult, and an excellent Youtube video shows how members of a Self Advocacy group have learned and begun to share their knowledge about mindfulness (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgTjnO22FI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgTjnO22FI</a>).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The University of Bangor has produced some very helpful guidelines for people working in this area: &lsquo;Good Practice Guidelines: mindfulness based programmes for people with learning disabilities&rsquo; (<a href="https://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/mindfulness-for-learning-disability.php.en">https://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/mindfulness-for-learning-disability.php.en</a>).</p>
  <p>In Sussex Partnership, groups have already taken place with children/young people with learning disabilities, and some of us working with adults have completed the Trust&rsquo;s Mindfulness Based Interventions training with the Sussex Mindfulness Centre, and have liaised about how to develop our work. We have received regular supervision from Bridgette O&rsquo;Neill, which has helped us think through a number of different relevant issues. We regularly support a local L&rsquo;Arche community, and they agreed to be a pilot site to help us develop mindfulness groups. An initial group was run in the Summer of 2019 (reporting back in a workshop at the annual Sussex Mindfulness Centre conference in October 2019). A second group &nbsp; started in February 2020, but has not yet completed due to Covid-19.</p>
  <p><strong>Some of the things we have been doing</strong></p>
  <p>&middot; We have tried to &lsquo;distil the essence&rsquo; of both the MBCT and MBSR&nbsp; traditional eight week mindfulness courses into our own simpler eight week format, and hope to produce a group protocol and adapted participant pack when the group ends</p>
  <p>&middot; We have borrowed and created several different accessible resources for &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mindfulness practice, such as visual/sensory prompts to help explain concepts and simplify practices. We are aware of the need for ongoing creative development of these resources</p>
  <p>&middot; We have recruited a local Self-Advocate with an interest in mindfulness, and some prior experience. She has been participating in the most recent group and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supporting facilitators, and is interested in helping with groups in the future</p>
  <p>&middot; We have liaised with others working in other areas of the country</p>
  <p>&middot; We attempted to evaluate our groups, but have not yet found a meaningful way to do this. We are planning to invite people to take part in interviews when we are able to finish the current group.</p>
