  <p><strong>Mindfulness For Adults With Learning &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Disabilities In Sussex Partnership </strong></p>
  <p>It's still early days for mindfulness interventions which try to address the particular needs of people with learning disabilities/intellectual impairment. Many of the published papers have focused on helping people learn a &lsquo;Soles of the Feet&rsquo; practice to cope when they find life difficult, and an excellent Youtube video shows how members of a Self Advocacy group have learned and begun to share their knowledge about mindfulness (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgTjnO22FI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgTjnO22FI</a>).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The University of Bangor has produced some very helpful guidelines for people working in this area: &lsquo;Good Practice Guidelines: mindfulness based programmes for people with learning disabilities&rsquo; (<a href="https://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/mindfulness-for-learning-disability.php.en">https://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/mindfulness-for-learning-disability.php.en</a>).</p>
  <p>In Sussex Partnership, mindfulness groups have already taken place with children/young people and adults with learning disabilities.</p>
  <p>We have received regular supervision from Bridgette O&rsquo;Neill, which has helped us think through a number of different relevant issues. We regularly support a local L&rsquo;Arche community, and they agreed to be a pilot site to help us develop mindfulness groups. An initial group was run in the Summer of 2019 (reporting back in a workshop at the annual Sussex Mindfulness Centre conference in October 2019). A second group &nbsp; started in February 2020, but has not yet completed due to Covid-19.</p>
  <p><strong>Some of the things we have been doing</strong></p>
  <p>We have tried to &lsquo;distil the essence&rsquo; of both the Mindfulness-based cognitve cognitive therapy and Mindfulness-based stress reduction&nbsp; traditional eight week mindfulness courses into our own simpler eight week format, and hope to produce a group protocol and adapted participant pack when the group ends</p>
  <p>We have borrowed and created several different accessible resources for mindfulness practice, such as visual/sensory prompts to help explain concepts and simplify practices. We are aware of the need for ongoing creative development of these resources</p>
  <p>We have recruited a local Self-Advocate with an interest in mindfulness, and some prior experience. She has been participating in the most recent group and supporting facilitators, and is interested in helping with groups in the future</p>
  <p>We have liaised with others working in other areas of the country</p>
  <p>We are working to evaluate our groups, possibly via interviews with participants after completing the course.</p>
