<div class="editable"><p>Dr Clara Strauss and Dr Kate Cavanagh have been awarded a grant to convene a Clinical Research Group (CRG) on the topic of &ldquo;Mindfulness based interventions in primary health care&rdquo; as part of the national Mental Health Research Network. The aim of the CRGs is to gather together a set of collaborators (academics, clinicians and public and patient involvement) to identify key research priorities for a specific topic and develop proposals for funding through the NIHR. CRGs run for two years and expected to submit at least two grant proposals.</p></div>
