<p>We conduct research on the potential benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for groups of people for whom interventions have not traditionally been available.</p>
</div>
<div class="editable">
<p>We have been evaluating mindfulness-based therapies for older people, young people, for people experiencing long-term, severe depression and for people who hear distressing voices. We are also involved in evaluating the potential benefits of self-help mindfulness interventions. Our mindfulness research is therefore aimed at potentially increasing access to evidence-based mindfulness-based interventions for those people who otherwise may not have access.</p>
