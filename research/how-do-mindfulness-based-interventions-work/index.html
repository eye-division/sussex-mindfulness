	<p>Mindfulness research has focused on addressing question of ‘do mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) work?’ rather than ‘how do MBIs work?’ Jenny Gu will be a University of Sussex PhD student, starting in September 2014, and her studentship is jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Sussex Partnership. For her PhD Jenny will be exploring the mechanisms by which MBIs might be working – that is, she is interested is how MBIs work. Jenny is particularly interested in mechanisms such as reduced rumination and increased self-compassion and her PhD research will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which MBIs have their effects.</p>
