<div class="intro editable"><p>At SMC we are passionate about research - researching how and why learning mindfulness can be helpful. Most of our research is about looking at the potential benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for groups of people where there isn't already good research evidence. Ultimately, the aim of our research is to improve access to effective mindfulness-based interventions to a wider group of people.</p></div>
<div class="editable"><p>We have been researching mindfulness-based interventions for people experiencing a range of mental health difficulties including obsessive-compulsive difficulties, depression and distressing voices. Some of our research focuses on working age adults but we have also been doing research involving young people and older adults.&nbsp;</p><p>We are also involved in evaluating the potential benefits of self-help mindfulness interventions. Our mindfulness research is therefore aimed at potentially increasing access to evidence-based mindfulness-based interventions for those people who otherwise may not have access.</p><p><a href="/research/funded-research/">Funded research</a></p></div>
