<div class="intro editable"><p><strong>Our Aims</strong></p><p>At SMC we are passionate about research - researching how and why learning mindfulness can be helpful. Most of our research is about looking at the potential benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for groups of people where there isn't already good research evidence. Ultimately, the aim of our research is to improve access to effective mindfulness-based interventions to a wider group of people.</p></div>
<div class="editable"><p><strong>Current Research</strong></p><p>We have been researching mindfulness-based interventions for people experiencing a range of mental health difficulties including obsessive-compulsive difficulties, depression and distressing voices. Some of our research focuses on working age adults but we have also been doing research involving young people and older adults.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a wide range of mindfulness-based self-help books, online courses and smartphone apps available. These could be a good way of extending the reach of mindfulness to people who may not be able to attend a mindfulness course. Our research is also looking at the potential benefits of these self-help mindfulness-based interventions for members of the public as well as for people experiencing mental health difficulties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="/research/funded-research/">Funded research</a></p></div>
