		<p>Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have become increasingly popular in recent years. MBIs are usually offered in a group format over eight sessions and there is good evidence that MBIs are helpful at reducing stress and improving wellbeing. However, they are usually offered in a group therapy format which is not available to everyone, it is not always possible for people to attend a group therapy (e.g. due to work or childcare commitments) and many people are reluctant to attend groups. However, there is growing evidence that self-help MBIs are helpful (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735814000026">Cavanagh, Strauss, Forder &amp; Jones 2014</a>), most often this takes the form of MBI books or online courses.</p>

	<p>The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend clinician-supported self-help based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for people experiencing mild or moderate depression. Given the evidence for self-help MBIs it is possible that self-help MBI could also be a helpful intervention for this group of people. Through a Sussex Partnership own-account research grant we are currently conducting a pilot randomised controlled trial in the primary care mental health service in East Sussex (Health in Mind) which compares clinician-supported self-help MBI to clinician-supported CBT for people experiencing sub-clinical, mild or moderate symptoms of depression. If the findings from this pilot study are promising we will apply for funding for a larger study in order to find out if clinician-support self-help MBIs might be a helpful intervention for depression.</p>
