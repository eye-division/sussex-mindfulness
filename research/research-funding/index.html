	<h2>Mindfulness-based behaviour therapy for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</h2>
	<p>The BeMind study has secured approximately £100,000 of research for patient benefit funding for a 19 month study to evaluate mindfulness-based behaviour therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The study is recruiting at our <a href="http://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/services/ocdclinic">OCD Clinic</a> at Health in Mind in East Sussex and in the wellbeing service in Brighton and Hove.</p>

	<p>Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a well-established and effective behaviour therapy for OCD and it is the psychological therapy recommended by NICE for OCD. However, about a third of people with OCD do not benefit from ERP. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have good evidence for effectiveness for a wide range of physical and mental health conditions, but evidence is lacking for OCD. However, there are good reasons why a mindfulness-based approach might be helpful for OCD and people with lived experience of OCD contributed to the design of this study and will meet to oversee the study whilst it is running.</p>

	<p>The study team want to see whether mindfulness-based ERP is more effective than ERP on its own and whether it has lower drop-out rates than standard ERP. BeMind is a randomised controlled study that will compare ERP with mindfulness-based ERP, with both therapies offered in a group format. The study is recruiting 40 adults with OCD and participants will be allocated at random to either a ten-session ERP group or to a ten-session mindfulness-based ERP group. Assessments will take place before the therapy starts, immediately after the therapy and again six months later. This will help us to find out if adding a mindfulness-based approach to ERP appears to be helpful. If it seems to be helpful the research team will apply for further funding for a larger study which will help to answer the research question more definitively.</p>

	<h2>Mindfulness for Voices (M4V)</h2>
	<p>The Mindfulness for Voices (M4V) study is a National Institute of Health Research funded study (£183,000) which aims to investigate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based group based therapy for people diagnosed by hearing voices (‘auditory hallucinations’). M4V has been developed by Professor Paul Chadwick (Chief Investigator) and his research team and it focuses on helping people to learn new ways of managing and living with their voices. The intervention incorporates elements of CBT but emphasises the principles and practices of mindfulness meditation.</p>

	<p>The randomised controlled trial finished recruiting the 108 participants in Sussex and Hampshire towards the end of 2013. Half the participants received the M4V group therapy over a 12-session period and the other half received their usual mental health care. Participant defined goals for recovery as well as measures of psychological health, anxiety, depression, self-esteem and mindfulness were assessed at baseline, post-group and six month after the end of therapy.</p>

	<p>Findings will be available towards the end of 2014 and if M4V is effective the research team will work with our local clinical services to look at ways of offering the therapy in the trust.</p>


	<h2>Mindfulness-based self-help for NHS staff</h2>
		<p>Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have become increasingly popular in recent years. MBIs are usually offered in a group format over eight sessions and there is good evidence that MBIs are helpful at reducing stress and improving wellbeing. However, they are usually offered in a group therapy format which is not available to everyone, it is not always possible for people to attend a group therapy (e.g. due to work or childcare commitments) and many people are reluctant to attend groups. However, there is growing evidence that self-help MBIs are helpful (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735814000026">Cavanagh, Strauss, Forder &amp; Jones 2014</a>), most often this takes the form of MBI books or online courses.</p>

	<p>Finding it difficult to find the time to attend an MBI group may especially true for NHS staff, many of whom work full time and have young families. At the same time, working in mental health care can be particularly challenging because of the emotional demands of the work.</p>

	<p>The Trust Board at Sussex Partnership have recognised this need and have funded two studies to evaluate the potential of self-help MBIs for trust staff. The first study ended in April 2014 and this was a feasibility study of self-help MBI in order to find out the type of self-help that would be most useful and engaging for staff. The second study, due to start towards the end of 2014, will be a pilot randomised controlled trial of the self-help MBI that emerges from the first study. Depending on findings, we hope that this study will help to widen access to wellbeing courses for our staff.</p>


	<h2>Low-intensity guided help through mindfulness for depression</h2>
		<p>Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have become increasingly popular in recent years. MBIs are usually offered in a group format over eight sessions and there is good evidence that MBIs are helpful at reducing stress and improving wellbeing. However, they are usually offered in a group therapy format which is not available to everyone, it is not always possible for people to attend a group therapy (e.g. due to work or childcare commitments) and many people are reluctant to attend groups. However, there is growing evidence that self-help MBIs are helpful (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735814000026">Cavanagh, Strauss, Forder &amp; Jones 2014</a>), most often this takes the form of MBI books or online courses.</p>

	<p>The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend clinician-supported self-help based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for people experiencing mild or moderate depression. Given the evidence for self-help MBIs it is possible that self-help MBI could also be a helpful intervention for this group of people. Through a Sussex Partnership own-account research grant we are currently conducting a pilot randomised controlled trial in the primary care mental health service in East Sussex (Health in Mind) which compares clinician-supported self-help MBI to clinician-supported CBT for people experiencing sub-clinical, mild or moderate symptoms of depression. If the findings from this pilot study are promising we will apply for funding for a larger study in order to find out if clinician-support self-help MBIs might be a helpful intervention for depression.</p>

	<h2>Can mindfulness be learned by people experiencing depression and anxiety?</h2>
	<p>There are a number of reasons why mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) might be challenging for people currently experiencing clinical levels of anxiety and depression. Firstly, the unpleasant content of thoughts and feelings might make it difficult for people to engage in mindfulness meditation practice as they become more aware of these unpleasant experiences. Secondly, the tendency towards rumination (common in depression) and worry (common in anxiety) might make focusing on the present moment very challenging and people might find it difficult to remain engaged with mindfulness practice. Thirdly, MBIs typically involve extended daily mindfulness practices at home and the low motivation often associated with depression might be a barrier to home practice.</p>

	<p>Lizzie Clark is a University of Sussex PhD student jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Sussex Partnership. Lizzie is investigating if people with current depression and anxiety can learn mindfulness. For her PhD she has completed a meta-analysis which shows, despite the cautions outlined above, that people diagnosed with a current episode of a depressive or anxiety disorder can learn mindfulness. She is currently working with trust mindfulness teachers to develop a brief MBI (4 sessions) specifically for adults receiving secondary mental health care with the intervention designed to address the issues outlined above. Lizzie is planning to run a feasibility study of the brief MBI in Sussex Partnership secondary care services towards the end of 2014.</p>


	<h2>How do mindfulness-based interventions work?</h2>
	<p>Mindfulness research has focused on addressing question of ‘do mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) work?’ rather than ‘how do MBIs work?’ Jenny Gu will be a University of Sussex PhD student, starting in September 2014, and her studentship is jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Sussex Partnership. For her PhD Jenny will be exploring the mechanisms by which MBIs might be working – that is, she is interested is how MBIs work. Jenny is particularly interested in mechanisms such as reduced rumination and increased self-compassion and her PhD research will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which MBIs have their effects.</p>
