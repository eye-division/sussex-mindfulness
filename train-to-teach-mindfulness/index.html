We have 29 members of staff trained as mindfulness teachers who are connected to a large network of skilled local teachers and a thriving team of researchers producing cutting-edge research into mindfulness interventions. Sussex Mindfulness Centre is a member of the UK Network of Teacher Training Organisations which includes training programmes deemed to meet certain agreed national minimum standards.</p>

	<p>We offer two training courses in teaching mindfulness based approaches and interventions. Both courses are scheduled to be held in 2017 and are open to people who have completed the eight week MBCT/MBSR course, have regular mindfulness practice, and can envisage and describe ways in which they could use the training after completion of the course. The closing date for applications for both courses is 21 October 2016.</p>

		<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/train-to-teach-mindfulness/mbct/">Foundation training in mindfulness based approaches (MBCT/MBSR)</a></h3>
		<p>This course is designed for people wishing to teach the eight week MBCT/MBSR programmes. The training uses an apprenticeship approach with a strong emphasis on supervised group facilitation, resting on a firm foundation of theory, regular feedback on teaching practice and daily personal mindfulness practice. The training model we use has been described in greater detail in the following publication: Marx, R., Strauss, C., Williamson, C. (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeships: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training. Mindfulness, DOI: 10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2. Graduates of the training, who have taught two groups, are eligible to apply for the national listing of teachers.</p>
