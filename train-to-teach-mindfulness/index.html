	  <h3><strong>Training programme in adapted mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs)</strong></h3>
	  <p><strong>2021 Training</strong></p>
	  <p>An ever growing number of people are drawing on mindfulness in their work and using adapted mindfulness based approaches. This training course is for people who wish to train to deliver mindfulness based interventions that are not eight-week programmes such as MBCT or MBSR. It is intended for those who don't need to complete the extensive training required to deliver MBCT/MBSR but who wish to be equipped to use adapted mindfulness based approaches safely and effectively.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>The training will start online and then transition to in person delivery as and when it is safe to do so. If/when this happens, participants will retain the option of continuing to join remotely, rather than in person. In 2020, we&rsquo;ve found that the delivery of the training largely online (via Zoom) has worked well. Fees are &pound;1,900, with an additional cost of a weekend retreat.</p>
	  <p>Applications for the 2021 intake, starting in February 2021, are now open.<em><strong> </strong>Applications should be submitted before (an extended deadline of) 16th November 2020.&nbsp;</em><strong>Applicants who are external to Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT) are welcome to submit their application forms early, for an early selection decision.</strong></p>

	  <h3><strong>Foundation training in mindfulness-based approaches (MBCT/MBSR)</strong></h3>
	  <p><strong>2021 Training</strong></p>
	  <p>This course is designed for people wishing to teach the eight-week MBCT/MBSR programmes. The training uses an apprenticeship approach with a strong emphasis on supervised group facilitation, resting on a firm foundation of theory, regular feedback on teaching practice and daily personal mindfulness practice.&nbsp; Graduates of the training, who have taught two groups of the same curriculum of MBCT or MBSR, are eligible to apply for the national register of teachers.</p>
	  <p>The training will start online and then transition to in person delivery as and when it is safe to do so. If/when this happens, participants will retain the option of continuing to join remotely, rather than in person. In 2020, we&rsquo;ve found that the delivery of the training largely online (via Zoom) has worked well. The cost of training is &pound;3,950 plus &pound;450 for a 5-day residential retreat.</p>
	  <p>Applications for the 2021 intake, starting in February 2021, are now open.<strong> </strong><em>Applications should be submitted before (an extended deadline of) 16th November 2020.&nbsp;</em><strong>Applicants who are external to Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT) are welcome to submit their application forms early, for an early interview and selection decision.</strong></p>

    <p>We are delighted to announce another fantastic training opportunity for staff in improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services to train as Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) teachers. The training is being delivered in multiple sites across England from March 2021 up to the end of March 2022 by a collaboration of UK Mindfulness Centres. The teaching and supervision are funded by Health Education England and are provided free of charge to IAPT staff, who, on successful completion of the training, will be able to deliver this NICE approved evidence-based therapeutic approach for people with recurrent depression within IAPT services.</p>
    <p>This training is for High Intensity CBT therapists with at least one year&rsquo;s post-qualification experience, working in IAPT Services. We are enriched by people's diversity on our training and would particularly welcome applications from people from a BAME background. IAPT services are invited to apply to a training course in their assigned locality. IAPT services should work with interested staff to identify their preferred applicants for the training. The service application form and trainee application form(s) with Equality Monitoring form(s) should all be electronically submitted together to the geographically relevant training centre by 5pm on Friday 20th November 2020.
