We have 40 members of staff trained in mindfulness, who are themselves connected to a large network of skilled local teachers and a thriving team of researchers producing cutting-edge research into mindfulness interventions. Sussex Mindfulness Centre is a member of the UK Network of Teacher Training Organisations which includes training programmes deemed to meet certain agreed national minimum standards.</p><p>We are now open to applications for our two mindfulness training programmes scheduled to run in 2018 &ndash; the training in Adapted MBIs and the Foundation training in MBAs (MBCT/MBSR) &ndash; see below. &nbsp;Both courses are open to people who have completed the eight week MBCT/MBSR course, have regular mindfulness practice, and can envisage and describe ways in which they could use the training after completion of the course.</p></div>

	<div class="half editable"><h3>Foundation training in mindfulness based approaches (MBCT/MBSR)</h3><p>This course is designed for people wishing to teach the eight week MBCT/MBSR programmes. The training uses an apprenticeship approach with a strong emphasis on supervised group facilitation, resting on a firm foundation of theory, regular feedback on teaching practice and daily personal mindfulness practice. The training model we use has been described in greater detail in the following publication: Marx, R., Strauss, C., Williamson, C. (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeships: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training. Mindfulness, DOI: 10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2. Graduates of the training, who have taught two groups, are eligible to apply for the national listing of teachers.</p><p><a class="button" href="/train-to-teach-mindfulness/mbct/">Read more&nbsp;<svg class="icon icon--readmore"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-double_angle_right" /></svg></a></p><h3>Find out more and apply:</h3><p>Fees for the Foundation training year are &pound;5,500 and the deadline for applications is 3rd November 2017.</p><ul class="nolist"><li><a href="/uploads/SMC Foundation training handbook 2018.pdf">Course handbook</a> <svg class="icon icon--readmore"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-download_alt" /></svg></li><li><a href="/uploads/Foundation MBA course flier 2018.pdf">Course flyer</a> <svg class="icon icon--readmore"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-download_alt" /></svg></li><li><a href="/Foundation blank application internal 2018.doc">Application Form for Sussex Partnership staff applying for Trust funding</a> <svg class="icon icon--readmore"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-download_alt" /></svg></li><li><a href="/uploads/Foundation blank application external 2018.doc">Application form for other applicants</a> <svg class="icon icon--readmore"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-download_alt" /></svg></li></ul></div>
