	  <h3><strong>Foundation training in mindfulness-based approaches (MBCT/MBSR)</strong></h3>
	  <p><strong>2020 Training</strong></p>
	  <p>This course is designed for people wishing to teach the eight-week MBCT/MBSR programmes. The training uses an apprenticeship approach with a strong emphasis on supervised group facilitation, resting on a firm foundation of theory, regular feedback on teaching practice and daily personal mindfulness practice. The training model we use has been described in greater detail in the following publication: Marx, R., Strauss, C., Williamson, C. (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeships: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training. Mindfulness, DOI: 10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2. Graduates of the training, who have taught two groups of the same curriculum of MBCT or MBSR, are eligible to apply for the national listing of teachers.</p>
