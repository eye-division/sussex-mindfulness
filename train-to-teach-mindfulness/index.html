    <h3>The UK Mindfulness Centres collaboration training in delivering MBCT in IAPT</h3>
  <p>We are delighted to be able to offer a fantastic training opportunity for staff in Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services to train as Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) teachers.

The teaching and supervision are funded by Health Education England and are provided free of charge to IAPT staff, who on successful completion of the training, will be able to deliver this NICE approved evidence-based therapeutic approach for people with recurrent depression within IAPT services.</p>
  <p>This training is for High Intensity CBT therapists with at least one year&rsquo;s post-qualification experience, working in IAPT Services. IAPT services are invited to apply to a training course in their assigned locality. IAPT services should work with interested staff to identify their preferred applicants for the training.
