  <p>Sussex Mindfulness Centre has been offering mindfulness teacher training since 2011. We have 60 members of staff trained in mindfulness-based approaches and a thriving team &nbsp;researching various mindfulness interventions. We are also embedded in a large national network of teachers, trainers and researchers and it is with the collaboration of our partners that we can provide much of this training. Sussex Mindfulness Centre is a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://bamba.org.uk">British Association of Mindfulness-Based Approaches (BAMBA)</a> &ndash; formerly the UK Network of Teacher Training Organisations, which recognises training programmes that meet agreed national minimum standards.</p>

	  <p>An ever growing number of people are drawing on mindfulness in their work and using adapted mindfulness based approaches. This training course is for people who wish to train to deliver mindfulness based interventions that are not eight-week programmes such as MBCT or MBSR. It is intended for those who don't need to complete the extensive training required to deliver MBCT/MBSR but who wish to be equipped to use adapted mindfulness based approaches safely and effectively.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>The training will start online and then transition to in person delivery as and when it is safe to do so. If/when this happens, participants will retain the option of continuing to join remotely, rather than in person. In 2020, we&rsquo;ve found that the delivery of the training largely online (via Zoom) has worked well.&nbsp;</p>

	  <p>This course is designed for people wishing to teach the eight-week MBCT/MBSR programmes. The training uses an apprenticeship approach with a strong emphasis on supervised group facilitation, resting on a firm foundation of theory, regular feedback on teaching practice and daily personal mindfulness practice.&nbsp; Graduates of the training, who have taught two groups of the same curriculum of MBCT or MBSR, are eligible to apply for the national register of teachers.</p>
