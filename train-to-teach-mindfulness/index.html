<p>The SMC brings together a significant group of people who are teaching, training, and researching MBAs in Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT). This includes a partnership of SPFT staff, experienced researchers at Sussex University, and experienced teachers and trainers in the local community.  The Centre has good links with local teachers with whom it aims to facilitate a collaborative network through CPD and other events, as well as with trainers and researchers in other mindfulness centres and universities in the UK.  The SMC aims to draw on the high quality training, good governance and the existing research evidence to offer high quality mindfulness provision. At the same time, it aims to develop new evidence by developing and evaluating innovative mindfulness approaches, and with groups that may not otherwise have been considered to able to benefit from MBAs.</p>

<p>The SMC training had its first intake in 2011 and was at that time a new model of NHS-based teacher training using an apprenticeship model. This had a strong emphasis on teaching from the embodiment of personal practice and learning through feedback and supervised teaching. (For further information about the development and evaluation of this model, see Marx, R., Strauss, C., Williamson, C.  (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeship: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training. Mindfulness. DOI: 10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2.)  Since then, the training model has retained its apprenticeship ethos and has moved from being predominantly an in-house MBCT training for NHS staff to being a more inclusive programme that trains both NHS and community teachers in key elements of both MBCT and MBSR.  </p>

<p>There is currently no means of accreditation for MBCT or MBSR in the UK. The Good Practice Guidelines (GPG) for teaching mindfulness-based courses (MBCs) published by the UK Network for Mindfulness-based Teacher Training Organisations (http://mindfulnessteachersuk.org.uk), of which SMC is a member, provides a set of standards that are considered nationally to be the minimum required for delivering quality in teaching mindfulness-based groups.  This SMC training programme enables graduates to meet the experience and training required by the national GPG and, with experience of running two groups, to apply to join ‘the Listing’ held by the UK Network of teachers who meet the GPG.</p>
