	<p>This course is designed for people wishing to teach the eight week MBCT/MBSR programmes. The training uses an apprenticeship approach with a strong emphasis on supervised group facilitation, resting on a firm foundation of theory, regular feedback on teaching practice and daily personal mindfulness practice. The training model we use has been described in greater detail in the following publication: Marx, R., Strauss, C., Williamson, C. (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeships: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training. Mindfulness, DOI: 10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2. Graduates of the training, who have taught two groups, are eligible to apply for the national listing of teachers.</p>

This had a strong emphasis on teaching from the embodiment of personal practice and learning through feedback and supervised teaching. (For further information about the development and evaluation of this model, see Marx, R., Strauss, C., Williamson, C. (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeship: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training. Mindfulness. DOI: 10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2.) Since then, the training model has retained its apprenticeship ethos and has moved from being predominantly an in-house MBCT training for NHS staff to being a more inclusive programme that trains both NHS and community teachers in key elements of both MBCT and MBSR.</p><p>There is currently no means of accreditation for MBCT or MBSR in the UK. The Good Practice Guidelines (GPG) for teaching mindfulness-based courses (MBCs) published by the UK Network for Mindfulness-based Teacher Training Organisations (http://mindfulnessteachersuk.org.uk), of which SMC is a member, provides a set of standards that are considered nationally to be the minimum required for delivering quality in teaching mindfulness-based groups. This SMC training programme enables graduates to meet the experience and training required by the national GPG and, with experience of running two groups, to apply to join &lsquo;the Listing&rsquo; held by the UK Network of teachers who meet the GPG.</p></div>
