	  <p>This course is designed for people wishing to teach the eight-week MBCT/MBSR programmes. The training uses an apprenticeship approach with a strong emphasis on supervised group facilitation, resting on a firm foundation of theory, regular feedback on teaching practice and daily personal mindfulness practice.</p>
	  <p>The training model we use has been described in greater detail in the following publication: <strong></strong>Marx, R., Strauss, C., &amp; Williamson, C. (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeships: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training. <em>Mindfulness,</em><em><em> 6</em>,</em> 253-263.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2">https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2</a><strong></strong></p>
	  <p>Graduates of the training, who have taught two groups of the same curriculum of MBCT or MBSR, are eligible to apply for the national register of teachers.</p>
	  <p>The 2021 year-long training is part-time and runs from the orientation morning on 12 February 2021 to December 2021. The cost of training is &pound;3,950 plus &pound;450 for a residential retreat.</p>
	  <p>The orientation session in February 2021 and Module 1 in March 2021 will be held online, by Zoom video-conferencing, as we think it likely that some form of coronavirus social distancing will be in place over the winter period and flu season. In 2020, we&rsquo;ve found that the delivery of the training largely online (via Zoom) has worked well. For the teaching days and events after March 2021, if coronavirus social distancing restrictions remain in place then these will continue to occur online, via Zoom. Otherwise they will be held in person in Brighton.</p>

	  <h3>From the course handbook:</h3>
	  <p>The Sussex Mindfulness Centre training had its first intake in 2011 and was at that time a new model of NHS-based teacher training using an apprenticeship model. This had a strong emphasis on teaching from the embodiment of personal practice and learning through feedback and supervised teaching. (For further information about the development and evaluation of this model, see Marx, R., Strauss, C., &amp; Williamson, C.&nbsp; (2014). Mindfulness apprenticeship: a new model of NHS-based MBCT teacher-training.<em></em> <em>Mindfulness</em><em>,</em><em><em> 6</em>,</em> 253-263.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2">https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-013-0254-2</a>) &nbsp;Since then, the training model has retained its apprenticeship ethos and has moved from being predominantly an in-house MBCT training for NHS staff to being a more inclusive programme that trains both NHS and community teachers in key elements of both MBCT and MBSR.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>There is currently no means of accreditation for MBCT or MBSR in the UK. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bamba.org.uk/teachers/good-practice-guidelines/">Good Practice Guidelines (GPG)</a> for teaching mindfulness-based courses (MBCs) published by the British Association of Mindfulness-Based Approaches (BAMBA), provides a set of standards that are considered nationally to be the minimum required for delivering quality in teaching mindfulness-based groups.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>This SMC training programme enables graduates to meet the experience and training required by the national GPG and, after running two groups, one within training and one of the same curriculum following completion of &nbsp;the training, to apply to join the register held by BAMBA of mindfulness teachers who meet the GPG.</p>
