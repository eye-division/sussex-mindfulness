	  <h3>Information taken from the course handbook:</h3>
	  <p>SMC has been offering a year-long Foundation training in Mindfulness-based Approaches (MBCT/MBSR) since 2011. More recently, it has become clear that an ever-growing number of people are drawing on mindfulness in their work and using adapted mindfulness-based approaches that are not the standard 8-week programmes, such as MBCT or MBSR. Although this adapted mindfulness work often requires great skill, practitioners have not necessarily had much training in delivering mindfulness-based approaches. This training is for people who do not need to complete the extensive training required to deliver MBCT/MBSR but who nevertheless wish to be equipped to use adapted mindfulness-based approaches safely and effectively.</p>
	  <p>For Sussex Partnership staff, completion of this training, or equivalent, will become one of a number of requirements needed to meet governance arrangements for delivering adapted mindfulness-based interventions.</p>
