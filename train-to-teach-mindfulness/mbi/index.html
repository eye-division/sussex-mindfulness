More recently, it has become clear that an ever growing number of people are drawing on mindfulness in their work and using adapted mindfulness-based approaches that are not the standard 8 week programmes, such as MBCT or MBSR. Although this adapted mindfulness work often requires great skill, practitioners have not necessarily had much training in delivering mindfulness-based approaches. This training is for people who do not need to complete the extensive training required to deliver MBCT/MBSR but who nevertheless wish to be equipped to use adapted mindfulness-based approaches safely and effectively.</p><p>For Sussex Partnership staff, completion of this training, or equivalent, will become one of a number of requirements needed to meet governance arrangements for delivering mindfulness-based approaches.</p></div>
