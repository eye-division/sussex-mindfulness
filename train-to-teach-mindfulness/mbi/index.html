	  <p>An ever growing number of people are drawing on mindfulness in their work and using adapted mindfulness based approaches that are not the standard eight week programmes, such as MBCT or MBSR.</p>
	  <p>This training course is for people who wish to train to deliver mindfulness based interventions that are not the eight week programme. It is intended for those who don't need to complete the extensive training required to deliver MBCT/MBSR but who wish to be equipped to use adapted mindfulness based approaches safely and effectively.</p>
	  <p>Fees for the 2021 Adapted MBI training are &pound;1,900, with an additional cost of a weekend retreat.</p>
	  <p>The orientation session in February 2021 and Module 1 in March 2021 will be held online, by Zoom video-conferencing, as we think it likely that some form of coronavirus social distancing will be in place over the winter period and flu season. In 2020, we&rsquo;ve found that the delivery of the training largely online (via Zoom) has worked well. For the teaching days and events after March 2021, if coronavirus social distancing restrictions remain in place then these will continue to occur online, via Zoom. Otherwise they will be held in person in Brighton. If/when the teaching days and other sessions return to in person delivery, we plan to make it possible for participants to continue to be able to join remotely, online, if it is not possible for them to attend in person.</p>

	  <h3>Information taken from the course handbook:</h3>
	  <p>SMC has been offering a year-long Foundation training in Mindfulness-based Approaches (MBCT/MBSR) since 2011. More recently, it has become clear that an ever-growing number of people are drawing on mindfulness in their work and using adapted mindfulness-based approaches that are not the standard 8-week programmes, such as MBCT or MBSR. Although this adapted mindfulness work often requires great skill, practitioners have not necessarily had much training in delivering mindfulness-based approaches. This training is for people who do not need to complete the extensive training required to deliver MBCT/MBSR but who nevertheless wish to be equipped to use adapted mindfulness-based approaches safely and effectively.</p>
	  <p>For Sussex Partnership staff, completion of this training, or equivalent, will become one of a number of requirements needed to meet governance arrangements for delivering adapted mindfulness-based interventions.</p>
